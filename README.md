Following this tutorial has refreshed me on using React Hooks such [useEffect, useState, componentWillMount] and has given me a first time look at some additional built-in hooks. Practicing custom React Hooks has also been very helpful. I intend to start using React Hooks much more frequently in personal projects going forward.
